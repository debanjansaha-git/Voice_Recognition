Speaker recognition can be classified into identification and verification.  
Speaker identification is the process of determining which registered speaker provides a given utterance. 
Speaker verification, on the other hand, is the process of accepting or rejecting the identity claim of a speaker.  
The system that we will describe is classified as text-independent speaker identification system since its task is to identify the person who speaks regardless of what is saying.
